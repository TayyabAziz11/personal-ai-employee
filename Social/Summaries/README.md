# Social Summaries

**Purpose**: Storage for aggregated social media summaries (daily and weekly).

## Directory Structure

All summaries follow the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_<period>.md
```

Examples:
- `2026-02-15_daily.md` — Daily social summary
- `2026-02-15_weekly.md` — Weekly social summary (Sunday-Saturday)

## Content Format

Each summary contains:

1. **Header**: Date range, period type (daily/weekly)
2. **Message Count by Channel**: WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter totals
3. **Top Conversations**: Most engaged threads with links to intake wrappers
4. **Engagement Metrics**: Likes, comments, shares (if available via MCP analytics)
5. **Action Items**: Plans created, approvals pending, actions executed
6. **Links**: References to related intake wrappers in `Social/Inbox/`

## Generation

Summaries are generated by `brain_social_generate_summary` skill:
- **Daily**: Runs at 11 PM UTC, aggregates current day's intake wrappers
- **Weekly**: Runs Sunday 11 PM UTC, aggregates Sunday-Saturday intake wrappers

## Use Cases

1. **CEO Briefing**: Weekly summary feeds into `Business/Briefings/` for executive reporting
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor social engagement trends over time
3. **Audit Trail**: Historical record of social media activity
