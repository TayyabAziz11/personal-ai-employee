# Business Accounting

**Purpose**: Storage for accounting-related intake wrappers and audit reports from Odoo integration.

## Directory Structure

Accounting files organized by type:
```
inbox__odoo__YYYYMMDD-HHMM__<object>.md      # Odoo intake wrappers (from watcher)
YYYY-MM-DD_audit.md                           # Accounting audit reports (optional)
```

Examples:
- `inbox__odoo__20260215-1500__unpaid_invoices.md` — Odoo watcher detected unpaid invoices
- `2026-02-15_audit.md` — Weekly accounting audit report

## Intake Wrapper Format

Odoo intake wrappers (created by `odoo_watcher` skill, optional):

**YAML Frontmatter**:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `source`: "odoo"
- `received_at`: ISO timestamp
- `object_type`: "invoice" | "payment" | "customer"
- `invoice_id` / `customer_name`: Relevant identifiers
- `amount`: Dollar amount (if applicable)
- `due_date`: Payment due date (if applicable)
- `status`: "overdue" | "unpaid" | "pending"
- `plan_required`: Boolean (true if action needed)

**Body**: Details about the accounting object (invoice details, payment info)

## Audit Report Format

Accounting audit reports (generated by `brain_generate_accounting_audit` skill, optional):

**Sections**:
1. Revenue breakdown by period
2. Expense summary
3. AR aging (current, 30, 60, 90+ days)
4. Late fees applied
5. Cash flow projection
6. Recommendations

**Data Source**: Odoo MCP queries (`odoo.revenue_summary`, `odoo.ar_aging_summary`, custom queries)

## Processing Flow

1. **Odoo Watcher** (optional) queries Odoo for unpaid invoices, overdue payments
2. Creates intake wrapper in `Business/Accounting/`
3. **Brain** analyzes wrapper, generates plan if action needed (e.g., send payment reminder)
4. Plan → Approval → Execution via `brain_execute_odoo_with_mcp`

## Use Cases

1. **Automated Alerts**: Detect overdue invoices, trigger follow-up actions
2. **CEO Briefing**: Include AR aging in weekly briefings
3. **Audit Trail**: Historical record of accounting events and actions
