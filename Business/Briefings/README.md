# Business Briefings

**Purpose**: Storage for weekly CEO briefings and executive summaries.

## Directory Structure

Briefings follow the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md
```

Example:
- `2026-02-17_Monday_Briefing.md` — Monday, February 17, 2026 weekly briefing

## Content Format

Each CEO briefing contains **8 required sections**:

### 1. **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
- Revenue (current week, month-to-date, quarter-to-date)
- Customer metrics (active users, new signups, churn)
- System performance (uptime, response time, error rate)

### 2. **Wins**
- Achievements from the past week
- Completed milestones
- Positive customer feedback or testimonials

### 3. **Risks**
- Current blockers or challenges
- Potential upcoming issues
- Mitigation strategies in progress

### 4. **Outstanding Invoices + AR Aging**
- Unpaid invoices count and total amount
- AR aging summary (current, 30 days, 60 days, 90+ days)
- Source: Odoo MCP queries (`odoo.list_unpaid_invoices`, `odoo.ar_aging_summary`)

### 5. **Social Performance**
- Social media engagement metrics by channel (WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Top performing posts or conversations
- Response time averages
- Source: `Social/Summaries/` and `Social/Analytics/`

### 6. **Next Week Priorities**
- Planned initiatives
- Key deadlines
- Expected deliverables

### 7. **Pending Approvals**

- High-priority actions needing executive decision
- Source: File count in `Pending_Approval/` directory

### 8. **Summary**

- Overall status: On track / At risk / Behind schedule

## Generation

Briefings are auto-generated by `brain_generate_weekly_ceo_briefing` skill:
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Sunday at 11:59 PM UTC
- **Data Sources**:
  - `Business/Goals/*` — Strategic objectives
  - `system_log.md` — Activity log
  - `Done/` — Completed tasks
  - `Social/Summaries/` — Social performance
  - Odoo MCP queries — Accounting metrics

## Graceful Degradation

If any data source is unavailable:
- Odoo down → "Odoo metrics unavailable (server unreachable)"
- No social summaries → "No social activity this week"
- No goals configured → "No strategic goals configured"

Briefing still generates with available data.

## Use Cases

1. **Executive Reporting**: Weekly snapshot of business health
2. **Board Meetings**: Export for board presentations
3. **Historical Record**: Track business progress over time
