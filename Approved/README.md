# Approved

Approved plans ready for execution.

**Workflow:**
1. User moves plan from Pending_Approval/ to here
2. Agent detects file in Approved/
3. Agent executes plan (dry-run first, then real execution after dry-run approval)
4. After execution, plan moves to Plans/completed/

**DO NOT DELETE FILES** - they are part of audit trail
