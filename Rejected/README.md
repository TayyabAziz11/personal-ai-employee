# Rejected

Rejected plans archived for audit.

**Workflow:**
1. User moves plan from Pending_Approval/ to here (if rejecting)
2. Optionally add rejection reason to plan file
3. Agent logs rejection to system_log.md
4. Files remain here permanently for audit trail

**DO NOT DELETE FILES** - they are part of audit trail
