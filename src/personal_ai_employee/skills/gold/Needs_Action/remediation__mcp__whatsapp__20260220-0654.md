# MCP Remediation: WhatsApp Web helper not importable

**Issue**: WhatsApp Web helper not importable
**Source**: WhatsApp Watcher (G-M3)
**Created**: 2026-02-20T06:54:57.721214+00:00

## Problem

ImportError: No module named 'personal_ai_employee'
Ensure Playwright is installed: pip install playwright && playwright install chromium

## Suggested Actions

1. Check `.secrets/whatsapp_credentials.json` exists and has valid credentials
2. Verify WhatsApp MCP server is running and reachable
3. Review Docs/mcp_whatsapp_setup.md for setup instructions
4. Test connection: `python3 brain_mcp_registry_refresh_skill.py --server whatsapp --mock`
5. Re-run watcher in mock mode to verify intake wrapper creation works
