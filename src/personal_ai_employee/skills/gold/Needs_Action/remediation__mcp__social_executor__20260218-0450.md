# MCP Execution Remediation: Approved plan not found

**Issue**: Approved plan not found
**Source**: Social Executor (G-M4)
**Created**: 2026-02-18T04:50:19.299677+00:00
**Original Plan**: unknown

## Problem

No approved plan found
Plans must be approved and placed in Approved/ before execution.

## Suggested Actions

1. Review original plan: unknown
2. Check MCP server status and credentials
3. Verify approval was not bypassed (plan must be in Approved/)
4. Review Logs/mcp_actions.log for detailed error context
5. Consider re-planning or adjusting action parameters
6. Test MCP connection: `python3 brain_mcp_registry_refresh_skill.py --mock`

## Safety Notes

- **NEVER bypass approval gates**: All actions require approved plans
- **NEVER use --execute without approval**: Dry-run is mandatory default
- **NEVER claim success on failure**: Stop immediately on errors
